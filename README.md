# Intermittent JSON Parsing Failure in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js application intermittently fails to parse JSON request bodies, even when the `express.json()` middleware is used.  The issue is difficult to consistently reproduce, and the `req.body` often appears empty (`{}`).

## Bug Report

The primary issue lies in how the `express.json()` middleware is implemented and interacts with the application server in some unpredictable scenarios (for instance, high load). This leads to an occasional failure in parsing the request's JSON body, resulting in an empty `req.body` object. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding an error handler to properly catch this condition, ensuring a more resilient application in production. The solution checks for empty `req.body` and provides a clear message for debugging purposes.  It also includes an increase in the JSON limit to accommodate larger payloads, which can sometimes trigger this issue. 

## How to Reproduce

The bug's intermittent nature makes consistent reproduction challenging.  However, it's more likely to surface under stress conditions like high request volumes.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `node bug.js`
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with a JSON payload. Observe the intermittent behavior.
5. Switch to `bugSolution.js` for a robust and fixed version.
